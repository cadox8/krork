# Krork API
To obtain the API you you must have [created your first project first](first.md).

Once having it, you can access to the [KorkAPI](https://cadox8.github.io/krork/javadocs/net/athonedevs/krork/api/KrorkAPI.html) by writing: ``engine.getAPI()``.
This will return a class called KrorkAPI which is designed to be the bridge between all the classes inside and it's the class you should use to develop your game.
