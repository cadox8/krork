# Getting started

## Getting the Engine
You have two options to start with Krork: **Maven** and **Direct Download**.

### Maven
You only have to add this to your **pom.xml**:
```xml
<repository> 
    <id>krork-repo</id> 
    <url>https://cadox8.github.io/krork/repo/</url> 
</repository>
```
```xml
<dependency> 
    <groupId>net.athonedevs</groupId> 
    <artifactId>Krork</artifactId> 
    <version>VERSION</version> 
</dependency>
```
<small>**Note:** You have to replace `VERSION` for the version you want to use (See [versions](https://cadox8.github.io/krork/versions.html))</small>

### Direct Download
Simple, just [download the version you want to use](https://cadox8.github.io/krork/versions.html) and add it as dependency in your favourite IDE.
